# Snake
Control a virtual "snake" which roams around its little world eating apples. Try to avoid causing its demise by not running it into itself or the edges of the world. With each apple the snake eats, it will grow larger.This in turn makes it increasingly difficult the snake to continue it's existance.


### Controls

Users should be able to:

- Move the Snake up and down
- Move the snake left and right
- Eat apples
